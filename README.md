# Homework-1-Horiseon-The-Maskless-Agency
First homework assignment. All it's asking is for an update on the links.

Challenges in This Course
Challenge Types
There are two types of challenges in this course. Each one is designed to prepare you for a scenario that you're likely to encounter as a web developer.

The two types of challenges are the following:

On-the-job ticket or feature request challenges give you starter code in a folder called Develop, which you'll modify to complete the challenge. Odd-numbered modules follow this format.

Job-seeking coding assessments or take-home assignments do not provide starter code. You’ll build these from scratch. Even-numbered modules follow this format.

Challenge Elements
Challenges adhere to a format that’s commonly used by software development teams that use agile project management to manage their work. Practicing this will prepare you for the workflows you’ll experience as a professional full-stack web developer.

DEEP DIVE
Each Challenge contains the following elements:

User Story: This is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who is requesting the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. This follows an AS AN / I WANT / SO THAT format. For example, "AS A shopper visiting an online store, I WANT to place items in a shopping cart, SO THAT I can purchase them."

Acceptance Criteria: These are the requirements that you must meet to satisfy the scope of work. They are not exhaustive, but they do entail the minimum aspects of a working solution. Consider this a checklist of baseline requirements. Acceptance criteria can be presented in various ways. In our case, we’ll use a common format called scenario-oriented criteria which expresses each requirement in a WHEN / THEN format. Don’t worry if this doesn’t make sense now; it will become very familiar to you after you complete a couple of challenges.

Mock-up: This is an image or animation that demonstrates the design and functionality of the web application that you'll build for the Challenge.

Submission: You'll submit your completed Challenge for review. In the real world, when a developer finishes working on a project, another developer reviews the code, providing feedback on errors and making sure that all of the acceptance criteria have been met. For each Challenge, your instructional staff will serve as your team of reviewers.

Your Task
This week is an odd-numbered week, so your Challenge is an on-the-job ticket, which means you'll begin with starter code that you need to modify. This week's challenge involves a very important aspect of web development: accessibility.

One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it (recall that to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. In this Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

NOTE
Your coursework this week will prepare you with all the skills that you need to succeed on this assignment!

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.

Even though accessibility is a broad topic that can include complex requirements, your tech lead has given you a small list of specific criteria to satisfy the project. These criteria are documented below in the Acceptance Criteria.

IMPORTANT
An important rule to follow when working with someone else's code is the Scout Rule, which recommends that you always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it.

To impress clients, you should always go the extra mile and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, make sure that all links are functioning correctly. Also, rework the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

Are you ready to jump in? Here are this week's challenge requirements:

User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
Mock-Up
The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
